# face-prediction
real-time age, gender and emotion prediction based on livestream webcam data

# pre-trained models
pre-trained models can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NvushEV_jqOcjT2zDv0CmUX-XJXJ7Epy/view?usp=sharing). Due to computational resource constraints, not all images from UTKfaces are used for training. Thus model performance are expected to be improved if more data are used.

worth mentioning that these models are not optimized and built for quick prototyping. There are more areas of improvements
